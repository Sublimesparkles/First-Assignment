    <h1 id="h1">About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Onihana Mary and my Altschool ID is ALT/SOE/023/3694. I joined Altschool in September and would like to be a frontend engineer. I joined Altschool to gain technology skills that would be useful in my journey as a frontend engineer. I got to know about Altschool through a friend who graduated as a backend engineer. I plan to complete the Frontend engineering program having gotten the required skills needed to begin my career.</p>
